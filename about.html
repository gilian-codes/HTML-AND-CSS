        <p>Motivational quotes often feel like our own opinions making a return visit, just augmented by someone with writing talent. And the right quote at the right time can change things—words matter, and motivating phrases
            can encourage us to get up, overcome tough times, take action, stop procrastinating, escape our comfort zone, motivate a team, invest in personal growth, start a business, and do the hard work that needs doing.
            Even genuinely successful people show some reverence to a favorite inspirational quote or two—to get through hard times, remember an important personal principle, or even get some inspiration to be more productive 
           while working from home. In business and life, quotes are short bits of wit and wisdom that are easy to revisit when we need them.
           
           That said, here are a few of our favorite motivational and inspiring quotes from a wide variety of sources. We hope you find a few you like and can revisit often to stay motivated.
